## Testing

### Local verification

- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` — clean
- [ ] `cargo nextest run --workspace` — passes
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace --doc` — doctests pass (if public docs touched)
- [ ] `cargo deny check` — no new advisories (if `Cargo.toml` touched)

None

## Canon alignment

- [ ] Reviewed `docs/PRODUCT_CANON.md` — no silent semantic drift, no new undocumented lifecycle
- [ ] Layer direction preserved (core ← business ← exec ← api; no upward deps)
- [ ] If an L2 invariant moved: ADR added under `docs/adr/`
- [ ] `docs/MATURITY.md` row updated if crate maturity changed
- [ ] Crate `README.md` / `lib.rs //!` updated if public surface changed

## Safety checklist

- [ ] No new `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!()` in library code (tests and binaries excepted)
- [ ] No silent error suppression (`let _ = …` on `Result`, `.ok()`, `.unwrap_or_default()` on fallible IO)
- [ ] Execution / engine state transitions go through `transition_node()` (no direct `node_state.state = …`) — see #255
- [ ] Credentials / secrets stay encrypted, redacted, and zeroized across all added paths
- [ ] New `unsafe` blocks carry a `SAFETY:` comment with justification

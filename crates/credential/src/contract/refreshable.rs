//! `Refreshable` sub-trait — credentials with refreshable [`State`].
//!
//! Per Tech Spec §15.4 capability sub-trait split — closes
//! security-lead findings N1 + N3 + N5. The pre-§15.4 shape declared
//! refresh capability via `const REFRESHABLE: bool = false` plus a
//! defaulted [`refresh`] body that returned a "not supported" sentinel.
//! A plugin author setting `const REFRESHABLE = true` while forgetting
//! to override `refresh` produced a credential that *declared* refresh
//! capability but silently never refreshed — the engine read the
//! sentinel as a benign outcome, no error class fired, the credential
//! eventually expired in production with no alert. The sub-trait
//! variant in this module makes that mistake structurally impossible:
//! only credentials that explicitly `impl Refreshable` can route
//! through the engine's refresh dispatcher, and `refresh` has no
//! defaulted body (`E0046` if omitted). The runtime back-channel
//! variant has been removed from [`RefreshOutcome`]
//! to seal the silent-downgrade vector at the type level.
//!
//! Engine `RefreshDispatcher::for_credential<C>` binds
//! `where C: Refreshable`. A non-`Refreshable` credential cannot be
//! passed — `E0277` at the dispatch site. Probe 4
//! (`compile_fail_engine_dispatch_capability`) cements this guarantee.
//!
//! [`State`]: crate::CredentialState
//! [`refresh`]: Refreshable::refresh

//! Registry-backed counters for resource operation tracking.
//!
//! [`ResourceOpsMetrics`] wraps a fixed set of [`Counter`]s from a shared
//! [`MetricsRegistry`], replacing the previous hand-rolled atomic
//! counters. Use [`snapshot()`](ResourceOpsMetrics::snapshot) to capture a
//! point-in-time view as [`ResourceOpsSnapshot`].
//!
//! Per slot model the credential rotation/revoke counters that the previous
//! `Resource::Credential` model owned have been removed. The per-slot
//! rotation hook shape is `on_credential_refresh(&self, slot_name, runtime)`
//! / `on_credential_revoke(&self, slot_name, runtime)`.
//!
//! Per credential isolation the rotation/revoke attempt totals are **one counter per
//! direction, labeled by `outcome`** over the closed set
//! `nebula_metrics::naming::rotation_outcome::{SUCCESS,FAILED,TIMED_OUT}`.
//! `Manager::{refresh_slot,revoke_slot}` record exactly one outcome per
//! dispatch from their `Ok` / `Err` / drain-timeout arms, so the unlabeled
//! attempts total is the *sum across outcome labels*:
//!
//! ```text
//! attempts == success + failed + timed_out
//! ```
//!
//! There is no separate bare attempts counter — that would be a redundant
//! second total of the same events. The labeled counter
//! (`*_ATTEMPTS_TOTAL{outcome=…}`) is the single registry-visible source a
//! scraper observes; [`OutcomeCountersSnapshot`] keeps an in-process view of
//! the same three series for tests and inspection.

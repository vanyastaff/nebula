# Vision: nebula-resource

## Mission Statement

**nebula-resource** aims to be the definitive resource management framework for the Nebula workflow engine, providing automatic, intelligent, and observable management of all infrastructure resources throughout their lifecycle.

---

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Declarative Resource Management

Resources should be **declared, not managed**. Users describe what they need, and the system handles acquisition, pooling, health, and cleanup automatically.

```rust
// Instead of manual management:
let connection = postgres::connect(url).await?;
// Do work
connection.close().await?;

// Users simply declare:
#[action(resources = ["postgres"])]
async fn process_data(ctx: &ActionContext) -> Result<()> {
    let db = ctx.resource::<PostgresResource>().await?;
    // Resource automatically acquired, pooled, and released
    db.execute("SELECT * FROM users").await
}
```

### 2. Context-Aware Everything

Every resource operation should be **aware of its execution context** - which workflow, which tenant, which user. This enables:
- Automatic multi-tenancy
- Distributed tracing
- Resource isolation
- Audit trails
- Cost allocation

### 3. Intelligent Defaults, Explicit Overrides

The system should work **out-of-the-box with smart defaults** but allow fine-grained control when needed.

- Default: Automatic pooling with sensible sizes
- Override: Custom pool strategies per resource
- Default: Global scope for shared resources
- Override: Tenant-level isolation for security

### 4. Observable by Design

**Every resource operation should be observable** without instrumentation code. Metrics, logs, and traces are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

### 5. Resilient and Self-Healing

Resources should **recover from failures automatically**:
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Health checks detect issues early
- Automatic resource recreation

---

## What nebula-resource Should Be

### The Complete Picture

nebula-resource is the **central nervous system** for infrastructure in Nebula workflows. It orchestrates the entire lifecycle of resources from conception to termination, with intelligence baked in at every layer.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Universal Resource Abstraction

**Every infrastructure component is a resource**:
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- Caches (Redis, Memcached, local)
- Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, NATS)
- Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob, local filesystem)
- HTTP Clients (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- External APIs (Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid)
- System Resources (threads, processes, file handles)

**Unified interface** regardless of underlying technology:
```rust
trait Resource {
    async fn initialize() -> Result<()>;
    async fn health_check() -> HealthStatus;
    async fn cleanup() -> Result<()>;
}
```

#### 2. Intelligent Lifecycle Management

**State Machine Excellence**:
```
Created → Initializing → Ready → InUse ⇄ Idle → Draining → Cleanup → Terminated
              ↓
           Failed (with auto-recovery)
```

**Features**:
- Automatic initialization with retries
- Lazy loading (create only when needed)
- Eager warming (pre-create for performance)
- Graceful degradation on errors
- Coordinated shutdown across all resources

#### 3. Advanced Connection Pooling

**Multiple strategies**:
- FIFO (fairness)
- LIFO (keep hot connections warm)
- LRU (evict stale connections)
- Weighted Round Robin (load balancing)
- Adaptive (ML-based optimization)

**Smart pooling**:
- Dynamic sizing based on load
- Per-tenant pools for isolation
- Cross-datacenter pool federation
- Predictive scaling

#### 4. Context Propagation & Tracing

**Automatic context flow**:
```rust
// Context automatically flows through all operations
workflow_execution
  → action_execution
    → resource_acquisition
      → external_api_call (with full trace context)
```

**W3C Trace Context** support:
- Trace IDs propagated automatically
- Span creation for each resource operation
- Baggage items for custom metadata
- Integration with OpenTelemetry

**Multi-tenancy built-in**:
- Tenant context in every operation
- Automatic resource isolation
- Per-tenant quotas and limits
- Cross-tenant data protection

#### 5. Credential Management

**Seamless integration with nebula-credential**:
```rust
#[resource(credentials = ["aws_access_key", "database_password"])]
struct S3Resource;

// Credentials automatically:
// - Retrieved from secure store
// - Rotated on expiration
// - Audited on access
// - Encrypted in transit and at rest
```

**Features**:
- Automatic rotation
- Just-in-time retrieval
- Lease-based access
- Audit logging

#### 6. Dependency Management

**Automatic resolution**:
```rust
#[resource(
    id = "api_service",
    depends_on = ["postgres", "redis", "http_client"]
)]
struct ApiServiceResource;

// System automatically:
// - Detects circular dependencies
// - Topologically sorts initialization
// - Ensures dependencies ready before dependents
// - Cascades health checks
```

#### 7. Health & Reliability

**Continuous health monitoring**:
- Configurable intervals per resource
- Multiple health check types (shallow, deep)
- Automatic quarantine of unhealthy resources
- Recovery workflows

**Circuit breaker pattern**:
```
Closed (normal) → Open (failing) → Half-Open (testing) → Closed
```
- Prevents cascading failures
- Automatic recovery attempts
- Per-resource configuration

**Retry strategies**:
- Exponential backoff
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Deadline propagation
- Idempotency detection

#### 8. Resource Scoping

**Flexible isolation levels**:

| Scope | Use Case | Lifetime | Example |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| Global | Shared infrastructure | Application lifetime | Metric collector |
| Tenant | Multi-tenant isolation | Tenant lifetime | Per-tenant database |
| Workflow | Workflow-specific state | Workflow execution | Temporary storage |
| Execution | Single execution instance | Execution duration | Transaction context |
| Action | Action-specific resources | Action duration | API client |

**Smart scoping**:
- Automatic scope inference from context
- Scope hierarchy (Global → Tenant → Workflow → Execution → Action)
- Fallback to broader scopes when needed

#### 9. Observability & Metrics

**Automatic metrics** (no instrumentation needed):
```
resource.acquisitions.total{resource="postgres",tenant="acme"}
resource.active.count{resource="postgres"}
resource.acquisition.duration{resource="postgres",percentile="p99"}
resource.errors.total{resource="postgres",error_type="timeout"}
resource.pool.utilization{resource="postgres"}
resource.health.score{resource="postgres"}
```

**Distributed tracing**:
- Every resource operation is a span
- Context propagation across services
- Causality tracking
- Performance profiling

**Structured logging**:
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Resource acquired",
  "resource_id": "postgres:v1",
  "resource_type": "database",
  "workflow_id": "etl_pipeline",
  "tenant_id": "acme",
  "duration_ms": 12.5,
  "pool_size": 10,
  "pool_available": 7
}
```

#### 10. Configuration Flexibility

**Multiple sources**:
- Code (programmatic)
- Files (YAML, TOML, JSON)
- Environment variables
- Remote config services (Consul, etcd)
- Feature flags

**Environment-aware**:
```yaml
resources:
  postgres:
    development:
      max_connections: 5
    production:
      max_connections: 100
      read_replicas: 3
```

**Validation & type safety**:
- Schema validation
- Runtime checks
- Type-safe builders
- Migration support

## User Experience Goals

### Developer Experience

**Workflow authors should feel**:
- "Resources just work"
- "I don't worry about connections"
- "Errors are handled for me"
- "I can see what's happening"

**Example: Ideal UX**
```rust
#[workflow]
async fn process_orders(ctx: &WorkflowContext) -> Result<()> {
    // Just declare what you need
    ctx.run(FetchOrders {
        resources: ["postgres", "redis"]
    }).await?;

    ctx.run(ProcessPayments {
        resources: ["stripe_api", "database"]
    }).await?;

    // Resources automatically:
    // - Acquired from pools
    // - Health checked
    // - Traced
    // - Cleaned up
    // - Retried on failure
}
```

### Operator Experience

**Platform operators should feel**:
- "I have full visibility"
- "The system self-heals"
- "I can trust the metrics"
- "Troubleshooting is easy"

**Example: Ideal Dashboard**
```
Resource Health Overview
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ postgres-prod     [████████░░] 80% utilized, p99=12ms
✓ redis-cache       [███░░░░░░░] 30% utilized, p99=2ms
⚠ stripe-api        [█████░░░░░] 50% error rate (circuit OPEN)
✓ s3-storage        [██░░░░░░░░] 20% utilized, healthy
```

### Resource Developer Experience

**Resource implementers should feel**:
- "The framework does heavy lifting"
- "Testing is straightforward"
- "Documentation is excellent"
- "Examples are clear"

**Example: Simple Implementation**
```rust
#[derive(Resource)]
#[resource(
    id = "custom_api",
    poolable = true,
    health_checkable = true
)]
struct CustomApiResource {
    client: HttpClient,
    config: ApiConfig,
}

#[async_trait]
impl Resource for CustomApiResource {
    // Only implement core methods
    async fn create(config: &ApiConfig) -> Result<Self> { ... }
    async fn health_check(&self) -> HealthStatus { ... }

    // Everything else is automatic:
    // - Pooling
    // - Metrics
    // - Tracing
    // - Lifecycle
}
```

## Design Principles

### 1. Convention Over Configuration

Smart defaults that work for 80% of cases:
```rust
// This should "just work" with sane defaults
let pool = ResourcePool::new(PostgresResource::default());
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Simple things simple, complex things possible:
```rust
// Level 1: Simple
ctx.resource::<Database>()

// Level 2: Configured
ctx.resource_with_config::<Database>(config)

// Level 3: Advanced
ctx.resource_builder::<Database>()
    .with_pool_size(50)
    .with_health_check_interval(Duration::from_secs(10))
    .with_custom_strategy(MyStrategy)
    .build()
```

### 3. Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully

Errors should be:
- Detected early (validation at registration)
- Reported clearly (rich error context)
- Handled automatically (retries, fallbacks)
- Observable (logged, traced, metered)

### 4. Performance by Default

- Lazy initialization (don't create until needed)
- Connection pooling (reuse expensive resources)
- Caching (metadata, configurations)
- Efficient data structures (lock-free where possible)
- Zero-copy operations (where safe)

### 5. Extensibility Without Complexity

- Plugin system for custom behaviors
- Hook points throughout lifecycle
- But: Core functionality works without plugins
- But: Simple resources require minimal code

---

## Non-Goals

### What nebula-resource Will NOT Do

1. **Replace specialized tools**
   - Not a database migration tool (use Flyway, Liquibase)
   - Not a monitoring system (use Prometheus, Grafana)
   - Not a configuration management tool (use Consul, etcd)

2. **Support every possible resource**
   - Focus on common infrastructure components
   - Provide framework for custom resources
   - Community contributions for specialized resources

3. **Be a distributed database**
   - State storage is for resource metadata only
   - Not for workflow data
   - Use appropriate storage for data

4. **Manage non-infrastructure resources**
   - Not for business domain resources
   - Infrastructure-level only
   - Application logic is separate

## Conclusion

**nebula-resource** should be the **gold standard** for resource management in workflow engines. It should make resource management:
- **Invisible** when things work (automatic, transparent)
- **Observable** when you need insights (metrics, traces, logs)
- **Controllable** when you need customization (configuration, plugins)
- **Reliable** when things fail (retries, circuit breakers, recovery)

The vision is ambitious but achievable through **iterative development**, **community collaboration**, and **unwavering focus on user experience**.

**Core Belief**: If resource management is difficult, users will work around the system. If it's easy, they'll embrace it. Our goal is to make it so easy that the alternative (manual management) seems absurd.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate the vision** with stakeholders
2. **Prioritize features** based on impact and effort
3. **Build incrementally** starting with core capabilities
4. **Iterate based on feedback** from real usage
5. **Grow the ecosystem** through community contribution

**Success is measured not by features implemented, but by problems solved for users.**

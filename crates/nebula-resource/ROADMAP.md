## Risks & Mitigations

### High-Risk Items

1. **Risk**: Async Drop in ResourceGuard
   - **Impact**: High (could cause resource leaks)
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper async resource release pattern early (Phase 1)
   - **Fallback**: Use manual release instead of Drop

2. **Risk**: Type erasure complexity
   - **Impact**: Medium (affects API usability)
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough design review in Phase 1
   - **Fallback**: Simplify API, accept some type safety loss

3. **Risk**: Performance doesn't meet targets
   - **Impact**: High (affects production readiness)
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous benchmarking, early optimization
   - **Fallback**: Adjust targets, focus on correctness first

### Medium-Risk Items

4. **Risk**: Credential integration complexity
   - **Impact**: Medium (affects security)
   - **Mitigation**: Work closely with nebula-credential team
   - **Fallback**: Manual credential management initially

5. **Risk**: Distributed tracing overhead
   - **Impact**: Medium (affects performance)
   - **Mitigation**: Make tracing optional, optimize hot paths
   - **Fallback**: Reduce trace sampling rate

6. **Risk**: Pool strategy complexity
   - **Impact**: Low (affects optimization)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple strategies, iterate
   - **Fallback**: Keep FIFO/LIFO, skip adaptive

- Ship early, ship often
- User feedback drives priorities
- Technical excellence is non-negotiable
- Sustainable pace is essential

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current ~40% implementation to a production-ready v0.5.0 release in 6 months (with 2 developers). The phased approach ensures:
- **Early validation** of core concepts (Phase 1)
- **Incremental value** delivery (new resources each phase)
- **Risk mitigation** through early addressing of complex items
- **Quality gates** at each phase boundary

Success depends on:
1. **Focus**: Resist feature creep, stick to roadmap
2. **Quality**: Don't sacrifice quality for speed
3. **Feedback**: Regular user feedback incorporation
4. **Iteration**: Continuous improvement based on learnings

**The goal is not to implement everything, but to implement the right things well.**

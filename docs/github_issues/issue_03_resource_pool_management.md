title: "[HIGH] Implement pool maintenance and shutdown for nebula-resource"
labels: feature, high-priority, nebula-resource

milestone: Sprint 5

## Problem

Resource pools are missing critical lifecycle management functionality: maintenance and graceful shutdown. This prevents proper resource cleanup and pool lifecycle management.

## Current State

- Maintenance stub: `crates/nebula-resource/src/pool/mod.rs:1043`
- Shutdown stub: `crates/nebula-resource/src/pool/mod.rs:1049`

Both methods contain TODO comments and no implementation.

## Impact

ðŸ”´ **HIGH Priority** - Resource pools cannot be properly maintained or gracefully shut down

**Consequences:**
- Resource leaks during application shutdown
- No periodic pool health checks
- No connection recycling
- Potential connection exhaustion

## Action Items

### Maintenance Implementation
- [ ] Implement periodic maintenance tasks
  - [ ] Remove stale/expired resources
  - [ ] Validate idle connections
  - [ ] Recycle unhealthy resources
  - [ ] Log pool statistics
- [ ] Add configurable maintenance interval
- [ ] Implement maintenance thread/task

### Shutdown Implementation
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown sequence
  - [ ] Stop accepting new requests
  - [ ] Wait for active resources to complete
  - [ ] Force-close resources after timeout
  - [ ] Clean up all pool state
- [ ] Add configurable shutdown timeout
- [ ] Return shutdown statistics

### Testing
- [ ] Add lifecycle integration tests
- [ ] Test maintenance cycle
- [ ] Test graceful shutdown scenarios
- [ ] Test force shutdown after timeout

## Files Affected

```
crates/nebula-resource/src/pool/mod.rs
crates/nebula-resource/src/core/lifecycle.rs (related)
```

## Design Considerations

### Maintenance Strategy
```rust
pub async fn maintenance(&self) -> Result<MaintenanceStats> {
    // 1. Check idle connections
    // 2. Remove expired resources
    // 3. Validate pool health
    // 4. Log statistics
}
```

### Shutdown Strategy
```rust
pub async fn shutdown(&self, timeout: Duration) -> Result<ShutdownStats> {
    // 1. Mark pool as shutting down
    // 2. Wait for active resources (up to timeout)
    // 3. Force close remaining resources
    // 4. Clean up pool state
    // 5. Return statistics
}
```

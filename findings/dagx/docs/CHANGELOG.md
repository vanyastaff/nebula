## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Now able to return bare tuples as task outputs
- No longer able to create a DAG with cyclic dependencies ([#3](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/3))
- The `#[task]` macro no longer requires an explicit return type ([#2](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/2))

### Changed

- Task inputs no longer need to be `Clone` ([#7](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/7))
- Building a DAG is now a single-threaded operation ([#12](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/12))
- Running a DAG now consumes the `DagRunner` and returns a `DagOutput` from which to get results ([#12](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/12))
- `#[task]` macro support is now gated behind the `derive` default feature
- Tasks now receive input via the `TaskInput` type, which guarantees via the public API that dependencies can be extracted ([#7](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/7))
- Task outputs are now extracted as owned values, not clones of an Arc value ([#7](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/7))

### Internal

- The `task_fn` macro has been extracted to the dagx-test crate
- Task inputs are passed to tasks directly from the runner, not through channels ([#1](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/1))
- Redundant tests/examples/benchmarks removed to lower maintenance and refactor burden ([#11](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/11))
- parking_lot dependency removed ([#12](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/12))
- futures dependency replaced with futures-util ([#8](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/pull/8))

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-10

[View changes](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1)

### Fixed

- **Custom types now work automatically!** The `#[task]` macro now generates inline `extract_and_run()`
  methods with type-specific extraction logic. This means **ANY type** implementing `Clone + Send + Sync + 'static`
  works automatically without implementing any special traits.
  - Previously, only types with `ExtractInput` implementations worked (primitives, String, Vec, HashMap, etc.)
  - Now, custom user types work seamlessly - just derive `Clone` and you're good to go!
  - No `ExtractInput` trait implementation needed for custom types
  - Nested structs, collections of custom types, and complex type hierarchies all work out of the box
  - New example: `examples/custom_types.rs` demonstrating custom types flowing through a DAG

### Changed

- **Documentation improvements**
  - Updated README.md to highlight custom type support as a key feature
  - Added "Custom Types" section to Core Concepts with examples
  - Added `custom_types.rs` to the examples list
  - Updated feature list to emphasize "Works with ANY type"

### Internal

- `ExtractInput` trait is now only used by the internal `task_fn` test helper
- The `#[task]` macro generates custom extraction logic per task, bypassing `ExtractInput` entirely
- This architectural change enables ANY type to work without requiring trait implementations

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-08

[View changes](https://github.com/swaits/dagx/compare/v0.2.3...v0.3.0)

### Added

- **Compile-time cycle prevention proof** via new `src/cycle_prevention.rs` module
  - Comprehensive documentation with `compile_fail` tests proving cycles are impossible
  - New integration test suite `tests/cycle_prevention.rs` demonstrating type-state pattern
  - Documents how the type system prevents cycles at compile-time (zero runtime cost)
  - Added prominent documentation section in README.md explaining the feature

- **New `DagError::ConcurrentExecution` variant**
  - Replaces misuse of `CycleDetected` for concurrent run protection
  - More semantically accurate error reporting

### Removed - **BREAKING CHANGES**

- **Removed `DagError::CycleDetected` error variant**
  - Cycles are provably impossible via the public API due to type-state pattern
  - Removed 24 lines of unreachable cycle detection code from `runner.rs`
  - **Migration**: If you were handling `DagError::CycleDetected`, remove that match arm
  - This error could never occur in practice, so no runtime behavior changes

### Changed

- **Documentation improvements**
  - Added comprehensive "Compile-Time Cycle Prevention" section to README.md
  - Updated lib.rs documentation to highlight cycle prevention as first feature
  - Fixed rustdoc links in `src/cycle_prevention.rs`
  - Updated all error documentation references (removed cycle detection)
  - Added code examples demonstrating type-state pattern
  - Updated tagline to emphasize compile-time cycle prevention

- **Test coverage improvements**
  - Added `#[cfg(not(tarpaulin_include))]` to untestable type alias
  - Coverage at ~83% after removing dead code (target set to 80%)
  - Remaining uncovered lines are primarily tracing macros and unreachable error paths

- **Enhanced CI configuration** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - MSRV verification now tests all 3 feature combinations (no-default, all, default)
  - Test matrix expanded to 18 runs (3 platforms × 2 Rust versions × 3 feature combos)
  - New cargo check job for all feature combinations
  - Lint (clippy) now runs on all feature combinations
  - Doc generation for all feature combinations
  - Coverage threshold set to 80% (accounts for tracing macros and unreachable error paths)

- **Release check script improvements** (`scripts/release_check.sh`)
  - Now reads MSRV from `Cargo.toml` instead of hardcoded version
  - Uses `cargo msrv verify` for all feature combinations
  - Tests all feature combinations (no-default, all, default)
  - Runs clippy, check, and tests on all feature combos
  - Includes coverage verification with 80% threshold

### Fixed

- **Clippy lints in test code**
  - Removed unnecessary `.clone()` call on `Copy` type in `tests/cycle_prevention.rs`
  - Removed unnecessary borrow in test dependency wiring

- **Flaky timing test on macOS CI**
  - Increased timeout threshold from 140ms to 200ms in `test_arc_parallel_execution`
  - macOS CI runners are significantly slower than Linux/Windows
  - 200ms threshold still proves parallelism while accounting for CI variability

  - New example: `examples/tracing_example.rs` demonstrating usage
  - Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/tracing/` for both with/without feature
  - Follows same pattern as tokio/hyper for performance-critical libraries
  - Updated documentation in README.md and lib.rs

### Changed

# nebula-validator
Composable, type-safe validation framework — two paradigms: programmatic combinators and JSON-serializable declarative Rules.

## Invariants
- `ValidationError` is capped at 80 bytes (`Cow`-based). Intentional: boxing adds indirection to every validation call. `clippy::result_large_err` is allowed by design — do not "fix" it.
- The two paradigms (programmatic `Validate<T>` + declarative `Rule` enum) are deliberately separate. Do not collapse them.

## Key Decisions
- `Validated<T>` is a proof token: validate once, carry the proof through the system. Don't re-validate the same value.
- `Rule` enum is JSON-serializable — enables storing validation rules in the database or config files.
- `ExecutionMode` controls which rule categories run (`StaticOnly` skips deferred/async rules for fast paths).
- Deep combinator types (`And<Or<Not<...>, ...>, ...>`) are inherent to the design. `clippy::type_complexity` is allowed.

## Traps
- `AnyValidator<T>` is type-erased (dyn-compatible). Combinators are concrete types. They are not interchangeable.
- `validate_rules()` takes a `serde_json::Value` — not a typed struct. Use the programmatic API when you have a typed value.

## Relations
- No nebula deps. Used by nebula-parameter, nebula-macros, nebula-action, nebula-parameter.
